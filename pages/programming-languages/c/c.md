# C

C is a general-purpose programming language created by Dennis Ritchie at the Bell Laboratories in 1972.

It is a very popular language, despite being old. The main reason for its popularity is because it is a fundamental language in the field of computer science.

C is strongly associated with UNIX, as it was developed to write the UNIX operating system.
