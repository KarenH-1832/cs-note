# Dynamic Data Structures

Dynamic data structures are data structures that grow and shrink as you need them to by allocating and deallocating memory from a place calledÂ the [heap](../memory-management/memory-structure#heaps).

Dynamic data structures allocate blocks of memory from the heap as required, and link those blocks together into some kind of data structure using pointers.
