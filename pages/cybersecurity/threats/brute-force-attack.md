# Brute Force Attack

In cryptography, a brute-force attack consists of an attacker submitting many passwords or passphrase with the hope of eventually guessing correctly.

Attacker attempts to guess a password by systematically trying out every possible combination of characters.

It is slow and computationally intensive, however, theoretically, it can be used to attempt to decrypt any encrypted data.

When password-guessing, this method is very fast when used to check all short passwords, but for longer passwords other methods such as the [dictionary attack](dictionary-attack.md) are used because a brute-force search takes too long.
