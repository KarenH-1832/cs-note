# Asymmetric-Key Cryptography

Each key pair consists of a public key and a corresponding private key.

Key pairs are generated with cryptographic algorithms based on mathematical problems termed one-way functions.

In a asymmetric encryption system, anyone with a public key can encrypt a message, yielding a cipher text, but only those who know the corresponding private key can decrypt the cipher text to obtain the original message.

## Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange

Diffieâ€“Hellman key exchange is a mathematical method of securely exchanging cryptographic keys over a public channel and was one of the first public-key protocols.
