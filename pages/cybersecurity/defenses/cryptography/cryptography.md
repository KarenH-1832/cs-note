- [One-Time-Pad (OTP)](one-time-pad.md)

## Modern Cryptography

- [Symmetric-Key Cryptography](symmetric-key-cryptography.md)
- [Asymmetric-Key Cryptography](asymmetric-key-cryptography.md)
- [Hash Functions](hash-functions.md)
- [Message Authentication Code (MAC)](message-authentication-code.md)
- [Salt](salt.md)
