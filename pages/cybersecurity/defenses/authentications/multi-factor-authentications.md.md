# Multi-Factor Authentications

Multi-factor authentications is an electronic [authentication](authentications.md) method in which a user is granted access to a website or application only after successfully presenting two or more pieces of evidence (or factors) to an authentication mechanism.

## Factors

### Knowledge

Knowledge factors are a form of authentication. In this form, the user is required to prove knowledge of a secret in order to authenticate.

A password is a secret word or string of characters that is used for user authentication. This is the most commonly used mechanism of authentication.

Variations include both longer ones formed from multiple words (a passphrase) and the shorter, purely numeric, PIN commonly used for ATM access.

### Possession

Possession factors ("something only the user has") have been used for authentication for centuries, in the form of a key to a lock. A security token is an example of a possession factor nowadays.

Multi-factor authentication can also be applied in physical security systems. These physical security systems are known and commonly referred to as access control.

### Inherence

These are factors associated with the user, and are usually biometric methods, including fingerprint, face, voice, or iris recognition.

Behavioural biometrics such as keystroke dynamics can also be used.
