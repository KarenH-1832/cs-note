# Data Analysis

Data analysis is the process of inspecting, cleansing, transforming, and modeling data with the goal of discovering useful information, informing conclusions, and supporting decision-making.

## Types of Data

### Qualitative Data

A categorical variable is also known as a discrete or qualitative variable and can have two or more categories.

It is further divided into two variants:
- [Nominal Data](pages/data-science/data-analysis/nominal-data.md)
- [Ordinal Data](pages/data-science/data-analysis/ordinal-data.md).

These variables are sometimes coded as numerical values, or as strings.

### Quantitative Data

Quantitative data is information that can be counted or measured—or, in other words, quantified—and given a numerical value.

It is further divided into two variants:
- [Interval Data](pages/data-science/data-analysis/interval-data.md)
- [Ratio Data](pages/data-science/data-analysis/ratio-data.md)

## Exploratory Data Analysis

The exploratory data analysis is an approach of analyzing data sets to summarize their main characteristics, often using statistical graphics and other data visualization methods.
