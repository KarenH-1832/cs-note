# Data Cleaning

Cleaning data is important because it will ensure you have data of the highest quality

Data cleansing is a process in which you go through all of the data within a database and either remove or update information that is incomplete, incorrect, improperly formatted, duplicated, or irrelevant.

## Missing Data

Missing data can come from random or systematic causes.
- Random missing data include data entry errors, inattention errors, or misreading of measures.
- Non-random missing data result from confusing, badly designed, or inappropriate measurements or questions.

Options:
- Accepting the data as they are
- Removing the case from analyses
- Recreating the missing data
- Imputation: replace a missing value with another value based on a reasonable estimate

## Outliers

Outliers are extreme values that differ from most other data points in a dataset.

Outliers can be true values (natural) vs errors.

Detecting outliers
- Sorting your values from low to high and checking minimum and maximum values
- Visualizing your data in a boxplot and searching for outliers
- Using statistical procedures to identify extreme values
