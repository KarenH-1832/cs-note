## Types of Data

### Qualitative Data

A categorical variable is also known as a discrete or qualitative variable and can have two or more categories.

It is further divided into two variants:
- [Nominal Data](nominal-data.md)
- [Ordinal Data](ordinal-data.md)

These variables are sometimes coded as numerical values, or as strings.

### Quantitative Data

Quantitative data is information that can be counted or measured—or, in other words, quantified—and given a numerical value.

It is further divided into two variants:
- [Interval Data](interval-data.md)
- [Ratio Data](ratio-data.md)
