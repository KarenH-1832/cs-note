# Ordinal Data

Ordinal data refers to a type of categorical data where the values represent categories with a clear order or ranking. Unlike nominal data, the categories in ordinal data have a meaningful sequence.

## Characteristics

- **Ordered Categories**: Ordinal data categories possess a natural order or hierarchy, allowing for meaningful comparisons between them.
  
- **Non-Numerical Labels**: While ordinal data may be represented using numerical codes, these codes correspond to the order of the categories rather than arbitrary numerical values.
  
- **Partial Ranking**: The order of the categories reflects a relative ranking, but the exact differences between categories may not be uniform or measurable.

## Examples

- **Consumer Satisfaction**: Consumer satisfaction can be categorized into levels such as low, moderate, and high. These categories can be assigned numerical labels like 1, 2, and 3 respectively.
  
- **Education Level**: Categories such as elementary school, high school, bachelor's degree, master's degree, and doctoral degree can be ordered from least to most education.

## Clarification

Ordinal data allows for the comparison of categories based on their relative positions in the sequence but does not imply any specific quantitative differences between them.

While ordinal data exhibit a clear order, the intervals between categories may not be consistent or measurable.

This distinguishes ordinal data from interval and ratio data, where the intervals between values are uniform and quantifiable.
