# Interval Data

Interval data is a type of quantitative data where values represent measurements with equal intervals between them.

Interval data not only provide information about the order of values but also the exact differences between them.

## Characteristics

- **Encoded Differences**: Interval data encode meaningful differences between values, where each unit of measurement represents an equal interval.
  
- **Equal Intervals**: The intervals between consecutive values are consistent and uniform throughout the scale.
  
- **No True Zero**: Interval data lack a true zero point, meaning that the absence of a value does not imply the absence of the characteristic being measured.
  
- **Defined Addition**: Addition operations are well-defined for interval data, allowing for the calculation of sums or differences between values.

## Examples

- **Celsius Temperature Scale**: The Celsius scale measures temperature in intervals of equal size. For example, the difference between 20°C and 30°C is the same as the difference between 30°C and 40°C. However, the Celsius scale does not have a true zero point, as 0°C does not represent the absence of temperature.

- **Dates**: Dates can be considered interval data, as they represent intervals of time (e.g., days, months, years) with consistent intervals between them. However, dates do not have a true zero point, as the absence of a date does not signify the absence of time.

## Limitation

Interval data cannot express the concept of a "zero" value in the context of the measured characteristic.

Additionally, interval data may not be suitable for scenarios where a true zero point is required, such as in ratio measurements.
