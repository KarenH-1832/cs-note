# Statistical Analysis

## Mean

Mean is also known as average in general terms. It is the most common measure to summarize any data set.

Using mean or average alone will not show the volatility

Examples:
- For a business, mean growth in sales or revenue over a period of the last five years may be a good way to represent growth.
- For a country, mean gross domestic product (GDP) over the last five years may be a good way to represent the health of the economy.

## Median

Median is the middle value by ordering the values in either ascending order or descending order

In many circumstances, median may be more representative than mean as it clearly divides the data set at the middle into two equal partitions.

## Mode

Mode is the data point in the data set that occurs the most.

## Percentiles/Quantiles

Divide the data set arranged in ascending or descending order into equal partitions.

Median is the 50th percentile.

Quartiles divide the data set arranged in ascending order into four sets of equal number of data elements.
- First quartile (Q1) as the 25th Percentile
- Second quartile (Q2) as the 50th Percentile
- Third quartile (Q3) as the 75th Percentile
- Fourth quartile (Q4) as the 100th Percentile

## Standard Deviation

The measures mean and median depict the center of the data set, or distribution.

Standard deviation specifies the spread of the data set or data values.

$$\delta = \sqrt{\dfrac{\sum^n_i(x_i-\bar{x})^2}{n-1}}$$

### Variance

Variance is another way of depicting the spread.

Variance provides the spread of squared deviation from the mean value.
