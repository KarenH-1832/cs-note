# Algorithms

Algorithms are sets of instructions used to solve a problem.

To represent an algorithm in code, the [pseudocode](pages/data-structures-and-algorithms/algorithms/pseudocode.md) is used.

## Analysis of Algorithms

### Correctness

Correctness requires a formal proof that the algorithm solves the problem.

### Complexity and Efficiency

Efficiency gives information about the expected behaviour of the
algorithm and is useful for making predictions and comparing
different algorithms. It bounds the algorithmâ€™s worst-case performance.

An algorithm is efficient if it runs in polynomial time.
