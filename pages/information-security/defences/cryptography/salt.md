# Salt

A salt is random data fed as an additional input to a one-way function that hashes data, a password or passphrase.

Salting helps defend against attacks that use precomputed tables (e.g. [rainbow tables](../../threats/rainbow-table-attack.md)), by vastly growing the size of table needed for a successful attack.
